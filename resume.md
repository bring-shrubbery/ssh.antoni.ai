## About

Senior Software Engineer who enjoys optimizing development workflows and
minimizing boilerplate. I never stop learning and enjoy sharing my experience
and insight with others.

I'm most proficient (and willing to work) with TypeScript (JavaScript), Swift,
Go, and Rust. I'm an expert in Python, but don't want to use it anymore.

On the tooling side, specialize in Full-Stack Development, UX/UI Design,
Machine Learning, and Game Development.

## Education

### MSc Artificial Intelligence at St. Andrews University `2019 — 2020`

> 📍 St. Andrews, UK

After dabbling in simple neural network design I decided to join this
course to learn more about AI in a more structured way. This experience
taught me a lot about AI and made me able to research and create my own
AI with the most suitable approach.

### BEng Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at Liverpool University `2016 - 2019`

> 📍 Liverpool, UK

This was a very dense learning experience. I learned the full spectrum of
things about computers, from low-level things like designing my own
silicon chip and making my own audio amplifier to high-level things like
data structures, game theory, neural networks, etc.

### Vienožinskio Art School `2012 - 2016`

> 📍 Vilnius

4-year art school study where I learned most of I know about sculpture,
composition, painting, sketching, photography, design and art history.

## Side Projects

### Random Excuse Generator `2022`

Inspired by a meme, I created this random excuse generator which generated
an excuse for not attending something via 3 part structure. Try it out to
get the reason for not attending that party you don't want to go to!

### useCookieConsent `2021`

React hook that simplifies management of GDPR consent for JavaScript/TypeScript
developers. This is something that I needed myself, and from the attention it's
getting I see that I'm not alone. It's still in development, but with v1 release,
it will cover all possible developer needs, including support for Vue, Svelte,
and others.

This swift package allows adding a nice-looking tooltip to your SwiftUI
app with one line of code. Can't come up with a simpler solution!

A compiler that transforms SVG code into SwiftUI Shape structure. It
allows converting SVG icons to Swift code to display in a SwiftUI app.

### rythmic `2020`

have the primary two tools they need to practice.
